    "- Process and create a dataset from downloaded .zip files\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",

    "## Introduction to business scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a travel booking website that wants to improve the customer experience for flights that were delayed. The company wants to create a feature to let customers know if the flight will be delayed because of weather when they book a flight to or from the busiest airports for domestic travel in the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with solving part of this problem by using machine learning (ML) to identify whether the flight will be delayed because of weather. You have been given access to the a dataset about the on-time performance of domestic flights that were operated by large air carriers. You can use this data to train an ML model to predict if the flight is going to be delayed for the busiest airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains scheduled and actual departure and arrival times reported by certified US air carriers that account for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues. The data was collected by the U.S. Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The dataset contains date, time, origin, destination, airline, distance, and delay status of flights for flights between 2013 and 2018.\n",

Traditional rule-based systems would struggle to generalize across these factors, while ML models can uncover hidden patterns.\n",
