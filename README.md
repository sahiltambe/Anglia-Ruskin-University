## MSc Artificial Intelligence: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Weekly Lab Tasks

## Overview
The weekly lab tasks and solutions for the neural networks and deep learning module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence programme at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) School of Computing and Information Science.

Labs are practical exercises that helps you get hands on experience to understand neural networks better along with machine learning concepts and its related technologies. It is organized to promote reproducibility of neural networks research, following nearly academic practices around documenting and submitting any work out to the scientific community.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
├── Week-1
│   ├── Week1-Lab.ipynb       # Jupyter Notebook for the Week 1 task
│   ├── Output_Graph.png  # Graph required for the lab logbook
├── Week-2
│   ├── Week2-Lab.ipynb       # Jupyter Notebook for the Week 2 task
│   ├── Output_Graph.png  # Graph required for the lab logbook
├── Week-3
│   ├── ... (Future tasks)
├── README.md             # Overview of the repository
```

## Objectives
This repository has the following main goals:



The primary objectives of this repository include:
- Understanding the concepts of **neural networks** and **deep learning**.
- Implementing these ideas in **TensorFlow**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.
- It records the precise nature of tasks it needs to perform in a manner that complies with academic standards.
- Ensuring the Reproducibility of solutions for academia review.

## Weekly Tasks
### Week 1: Linear Regression with TensorFlow
- **Objective:** Implement a linear regression model using TensorFlow to fit a line to a given dataset.
- **Outcome:**
  - Learn how to optimize weights and biases.
  - Create and plot the fitted line with the original dataset.
  - Produce a neat, labelled diagram for insertion into the lab notebook.


### Week 2: *To Be Added*
- Task details will be updated once completed.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive notebook for coding, visualization, and documentation.
- **TensorFlow**: Library for numerical computation and deep learning.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating publication-quality graphs.
- **NumPy**: Numerical library for efficient array operations.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahiltambe/Anglia-Ruskin-University.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired week's folder:
   ```bash
   cd Week-1
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Week1-Lab.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Future Work
Every week, this repository will contain new solutions for the lab exercises. Each submission will include:
- Practical tasks with annotated Jupyter Notebooks
- Visualisation required for lab logbook.
- Possible theoretical aspects Thursday documentation.
